# gmail API

## Question

I have an golang application running on a workstation and I want it to be able to use a gmail account to send/receive emails. What do I need to do to get this to work.

## Gemini answer

Okay, this is a common scenario. Since your Go application is running on a workstation (not on Google Cloud), and you want it to interact with a Gmail account , Google Cloud IAM roles aren't directly involved in granting the email sending/receiving permissions itself. Instead, you'll be using Google's APIs for Gmail.

Here's what you need to do, broken down into steps:

1. Set Up a Google Cloud Project (If you haven't already)
Even though your app is on a workstation, you need a Google Cloud project to enable the Gmail API and generate credentials.
* Go to the Google Cloud Console .
* Create a new project or select an existing one.

2. Enable the Gmail API
Your application needs permission to interact with Gmail.
* In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to APIs & Services > Library .
* Search for "Gmail API" and select it.
* Click the Enable button.

3. Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials
This is crucial for your application to securely access a user's Gmail account without storing their password. OAuth 2.0 allows you to get an access token after the user grants permission.
* In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials.
* Click + **Create Credentials** and select **OAuth client ID**.
* **Application type:** Choose "Desktop app" (since it's a Go application on a workstation).
* Give it a name (e.g., "MyGoGmailApp").
* Click **Create**.
* **Download the JSON file** that contains your client ID and client secret. This file is your credentials.json (or similar name). Keep this file secure!

4. Configure the OAuth Consent Screen
Before users (even yourself) can grant your application access, you need to configure the OAuth consent screen.
* In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent** screen.
* **User Type:** Choose "External" (unless your organization manages users within Google Workspace, then "Internal" might apply).
* Click **Create**.
* Fill in the required information:
    * **App name:** A user-friendly name for your application (e.g., "My Go Email Sender").
    * **User support email:** Your email address.
    * **Developer contact information:** Your email address.
* **Add Scopes:** This is where you define what permissions your app needs. For sending and receiving emails, you'll likely need:
    * https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send (for sending emails)
    * https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly (for reading emails)
    * https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify (if you need to mark emails as read, move them, etc.)
    * **Important:** Start with the minimum scopes you need.
* Save and continue.
* **Test Users:** If your app is not yet verified (which it won't be initially), you'll need to add your own Gmail account(s) as "test users" so you can test the authentication flow.

5. Implement OAuth 2.0 Flow in Your Go Application
This is the core of your Go code. You'll use the downloaded credentials.json file.

* **Initial Authorization:** The first time your app runs, or when the access token expires/is revoked, it needs to prompt the user to authorize access via a web browser.
    * Your Go app will open a URL in the user's default browser.
    * The user logs into their Gmail account and grants permission.
    * Google redirects back to a localhost URL your app is listening on (or displays an authorization code).
    * Your Go app captures the authorization code.
    * Your Go app exchanges this authorization code for an **access token** and a **refresh token**.
* **Store Tokens Securely:** The **refresh token** is key. It allows your application to obtain new access tokens without re-prompting the user. **You must store the refresh token securely** (e.g., in a file, environment variable, or secure storage on your workstation).
* **Use Access Token:** For subsequent API calls (sending/receiving emails), your application uses the access token. If the access token expires, use the refresh token to get a new one.

**Google's Go samples for Gmail API are invaluable here:**

Search for "Gmail API Go Quickstart" or "Gmail API Go examples" from Google's official documentation. They typically provide a good starting point for the OAuth flow.

6. Sending Emails with Gmail API (Go)

Once authenticated, you'll use the google.golang.org/api/gmail/v1 package.

* Construct an email message in the raw RFC 2822 format (Base64 encoded).
* Use the gmail.Service.Users.Messages.Send method.

7. Receiving Emails with Gmail API (Go)
    * Use the gmail.Service.Users.Messages.List method to get a list of message IDs. You can filter by labels (e.g., "INBOX", "UNREAD").
    * For each message ID, use gmail.Service.Users.Messages.Get to retrieve the full message content.
    * Parse the message content (which will likely be Base64 encoded and contain MIME parts) to extract headers, body, attachments, etc.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Security:** Never hardcode client secrets or refresh tokens in your source code. Use environment variables, configuration files (loaded securely), or other secure storage mechanisms.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for API calls, network issues, and token expiration.
* **Rate Limits:** Be aware of Gmail API rate limits to avoid getting blocked.
* **User Experience:** Make the initial authorization flow clear for the user.
* **Gmail API vs. SMTP:** While the Gmail API is generally preferred for its features and security when interacting with Gmail accounts programmatically, you could technically use standard SMTP with a Gmail account, but it often requires "App Passwords" for 2-Factor Authentication enabled accounts, and is less feature-rich than the API. The API is generally recommended.
