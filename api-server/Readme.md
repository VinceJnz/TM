## data access management

There are 3 issues to consider:
1. Does the user have access to the resource (Table)?
    1. Not viable: Implement in the DB if the DB has the user ID. The current design does not provide the user ID to the DB sothis cant be implemented
    2. Implement in the handler. The handler has the user ID and resource name, but each hander will be required to run a query to determine access.
    3. Implement a wrapper handler to inspect/check the resource access. Simpler implementation than point 2.

2. What rows does the user have access to?
3. What columns does the user have access to?



User groups provide members access to records (aka resources). The records are filtered by ownership.
User groups have an admin flag. If this is set then members of the group can access all the records of the associated resources regardless of ownership.


## New queries

Count the number participants above and below max_participants threshold

```sql
WITH booking_order AS (
    SELECT 
        atb.trip_id,
        atbp.id as participant_id,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY atb.trip_id ORDER BY atbp.id ASC) AS booking_position
    FROM public.at_booking_people atbp
	JOIN public.at_bookings atb ON atb.id=atbp.booking_id
)
SELECT 
    trip_id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN booking_position <= att.max_participants THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS before_threshold,
    SUM(CASE WHEN booking_position > att.max_participants THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS after_threshold,
	STRING_AGG(CASE WHEN booking_position <= att.max_participants THEN participant_id::text END, ', ') AS before_threshold_ids,

FROM booking_order
JOIN public.at_trips att ON att.id=booking_order.trip_id

List participants above and below max_participants threshold

```sql

## Query to get the total costs of a booking

Generic booking list

```sql
SELECT att.id AS trip_id, att.trip_name, atb.id AS booking_id, atb.notes AS booking_notes, atb.owner_id, SUM(attc.amount) AS booking_cost, COUNT(stu.name) as person_count
FROM at_trips att
LEFT JOIN at_bookings atb ON atb.trip_id=att.id
LEFT JOIN at_booking_people atbp ON atbp.booking_id=atb.id

LEFT JOIN at_trip_cost_groups attcg ON attcg.id=att.trip_cost_group_id
LEFT JOIN at_trip_costs attc ON attc.trip_cost_group_id=att.trip_cost_group_id
						AND attc.member_status_id=stu.member_status_id
						AND attc.user_age_group_id=stu.user_age_group_id
GROUP BY att.id, att.trip_name, atb.id
ORDER BY att.trip_name, atb.id
```

My Booking list

```sql
SELECT att.trip_name, atb.*, ebs.status, SUM(attc.amount) AS booking_cost, COUNT(stu.name) as participants
FROM at_trips att
LEFT JOIN at_bookings atb ON atb.trip_id=att.id

WHERE atb.owner_id = $1 OR true=$2
GROUP BY att.id, att.trip_name, atb.id, ebs.status
