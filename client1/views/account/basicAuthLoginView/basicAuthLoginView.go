package basicAuthLoginView

//This package provides the view for basic authentication login.
//It includes the necessary data structures and functions to render the login page and handle user input for basic authentication.
//The view will typically include fields for username and password, as well as any error messages or additional information needed for the login process.
// The basic auth process involves finding the username or email address in the database,
// then emailing the user a one-time password (OTP) that they can use to log in. This is a secure way to authenticate users without storing their passwords.
